Kernel for Sony Xperia Z2 Castor (it's working on custom rom).
This kernel can activate internal wireless monitor mode (for Nethunter) and has patches for usb hid keyboard.
The Wireless chipset is the same with Nexus 5 , so Nexmon and Hijacker is working very well.

For Nexmon os Hijacker this kernel is not necessary to be installed (it's working on custom rom).


How to install:

1.Install a custom rom (ex: aicp or ressurection remix) and root it.
2.Install Nethunter generic arm (full).
3.Install my kernel.
